# Mechatronics Maple Project

## Overview

This repository contains the source files, examples, and documentation for a Maple project focused on mechatronics. The project explores various aspects of mechatronics, including the modeling, analysis, and simulation of mechanical, electrical, and control systems using Maple.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`src/`**: Contains the main Maple worksheets and source code files.
  - `Homework1_StefanoTonini.mw`: The main Maple worksheet for the project.
  
- **`docs/`**: Documentation related to the project, including reports, references, and instructions.
  - `project_report.pdf`: A detailed report of the projectâ€™s objectives, methods, and results.
  
- **`examples/`**: Example files that demonstrate specific functionalities or concepts from the project.
  - `example1.mw`: An example Maple worksheet illustrating a specific analysis.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with the files in this repository, you need to have Maple installed on your system. You can download and install Maple from the [official Maple website](https://www.maplesoft.com/products/Maple/).

### Opening the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mechatronics-maple-project.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the `src/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd mechatronics-maple-project/src
   ```
   
3. Open the `Homework1_StefanoTonini.mw` file in Maple to start exploring the project.

### Running Examples

To run any of the example worksheets:

1. Navigate to the `examples/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../examples
   ```
   
2. Open the desired `.mw` file in Maple and follow the instructions within the worksheet.

## Project Details

### Objectives
