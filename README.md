# Mechatronics Maple Project

## Overview

This repository contains the source files, examples, and documentation for a Maple project focused on mechatronics. The project models and analyzes mechatronic systems using various methods such as PVW (Principle of Virtual Work), Linear Graphs, and Lagrangian mechanics. It also includes cinematic and dynamic analysis of a 2D mechatronics system.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`src/`**: Contains the main Maple worksheets and source code files.
  - `Homework1_StefanoTonini.mw`: A worksheet focusing on mechatronic system modeling.
  - `Homework2_StefanoTonini.mw`: A worksheet modeling the cinematic and dynamic systems of a 2D mechatronics system using PVW, Linear Graphs, and Lagrange mechanics.
  
- **`docs/`**: Documentation related to the project, including reports, references, and instructions.
  - `project_report.pdf`: A detailed report of the projectâ€™s objectives, methods, and results.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with the files in this repository, you need to have Maple installed on your system. You can download and install Maple from the [official Maple website](https://www.maplesoft.com/products/Maple/).

### Opening the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mechatronics-maple-project.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the `src/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd mechatronics-maple-project/src
   ```
   
3. Open any of the `.mw` files in Maple:
   - `Homework1_StefanoTonini.mw` for system modeling.
   - `Homework2_StefanoTonini.mw` for cinematic and dynamic analysis using PVW, Linear Graph, and Lagrange.

### Running Examples

To run any of the example worksheets:

1. Navigate to the `examples/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../examples
   ```
   
2. Open the desired `.mw` file in Maple and follow the instructions within the worksheet.
